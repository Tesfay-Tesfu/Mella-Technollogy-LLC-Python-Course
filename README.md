# Data Analysis Using Python - Course Overview

## Course Description
This course, offered by **Mella Technology Services LLC**, provides a comprehensive introduction to data analysis using Python. Designed for beginners to intermediate learners, the curriculum covers essential Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Students will gain hands-on experience in data manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using real-world datasets.

## Key Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Use Python fundamentals for data analysis (variables, loops, functions, data structures).
- Manipulate and clean data with Pandas (DataFrames, Series, handling missing values).
- Perform statistical analysis using NumPy and SciPy.
- Create insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Conduct end-to-end EDA on real datasets (CSV, Excel, JSON).
- Complete a capstone project showcasing their skills.

## Course Outline
### Weeks 1â€“6: Core Topics
- **Week 1**: Python basics, Jupyter Notebook, and essential libraries.
- **Week 2**: Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets) for data analysis.
- **Week 3**: Pandas for data manipulation (filtering, sorting, aggregation).
- **Week 4**: Data cleaning (duplicates, outliers, merging datasets).
- **Week 5**: Exploratory Data Analysis (descriptive statistics, correlation).
- **Week 6**: Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, storytelling).

### Weeks 7â€“12: Capstone & Real-World Applications
- **Weeks 7â€“10**: End-to-end project using real-world datasets.
- **Weeks 11â€“12**: Top project selection, refinement, and launch on Mellaâ€™s platform.

## Tools & Software
- **Python**: Version 3.7+.
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
- **Key Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Basemap.
- **Advanced Tools**: Handling netCDF/FITS files, geographic mapping, time-series animations.

## Assessment
- **Quizzes & Exercises**: 25% (weekly coding tasks).
- **Assignments**: 25% (hands-on data analysis).
- **Final Project**: 50% (EDA on a provided dataset).
